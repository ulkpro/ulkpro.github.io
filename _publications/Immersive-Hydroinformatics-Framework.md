This study introduces a novel framework with the use of extended reality (XR) systems in hydrology, particularly focusing on immersive visualization of hydrologic data for enhanced environmental planning and decision making. The study details the shift from traditional 2D data visualization methods in hydrology to more advanced XR technologies, including virtual and augmented reality. Unlike static 2D maps or charts that require cross-referencing disparate data sources, this system consolidates real-time, multivariate datasets, such as streamflow, precipitation, and terrain, into a single interactive, spatially contextualized 3D environment. Immersive information systems facilitate dynamic interaction with real-time hydrological and meteorological datasets for various stakeholders and use cases, and pave the way for metaverse and digital twin systems. This system, accessible via web browsers and XR devices, allows users to navigate a 3D representation of the continental United States. The paper addresses the current limitations in hydrological visualization, methodology, and system architecture while discussing the challenges, limitations, and future directions to extend its applicability to a wider range of environmental management and disaster response scenarios. Future application potential includes climate resilience planning, immersive disaster preparedness training, and public education, where stakeholders can explore scenario-based outcomes within a virtual space to support real-time or anticipatory decision making.
