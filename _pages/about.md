I am Uditha Herath Mudiyanselage, a dedicated Computer Science professional currently pursuing my Master's degree at the [University of Iowa.](https://cs.uiowa.edu/) I serve as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [UIHI Lab](https://hydroinformatics.uiowa.edu/) under [Professor Ibrahim Demir](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/ibrahim-demir), where I leverage emerging technologies to advance the geospatial domain. My work involves developing digital twins, immersive information systems, and simulations that enhance spatial data visualization and analysis.

In parallel, I focus on deep learning techniques tailored for image-related challenges. This includes designing and implementing models that push the boundaries of image recognition, segmentation, and enhancement. My research aims to integrate these sophisticated deep learning approaches with immersive technologies to create more intuitive and interactive experiences.

Before my current academic endeavors, I spent four years at [Axiata Digital Labs](https://www.axiatadigitallabs.com/) in Sri Lanka, where I worked on enterprise systems, honing my skills in software development and systems integration. I am passionate about mentoring and actively engage in community initiatives, contributing to educational programs and hackathons.

Research
======
Research plays a pivotal role in my career journey, focusing on advancing hydrology through immersive information systems and digital twins. Currently, my research at IIHRâ€”Hydroscience & Engineering, University of Iowa, involves leveraging Unreal Engine, C++, Cesium, and REST APIs from USGS and NOAA to visualize and simulate hydrological data. This work aims to enhance environmental planning and decision-making processes. I am also exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to optimize these simulations. My efforts are documented in a forthcoming manuscript, poised to contribute to cutting-edge developments in hydroinformatics.
