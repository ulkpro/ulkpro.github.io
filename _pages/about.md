I am Uditha Herath Mudiyanselage, a dedicated Computer Science professional currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Iowa. With a strong foundation in software development and Machine Learning, I specialize in developing and applying advanced ML models to solve complex challenges and drive data-driven decisions. My current research focuses on creating immersive information systems and digital twins for hydrology using Unreal Engine, Cesium, and advanced APIs. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about mentoring and community engagement, volunteering in educational initiatives and hackathons.

======
Research plays a pivotal role in my career journey, focusing on advancing hydrology through immersive information systems and digital twins. Currently, my research at IIHRâ€”Hydroscience & Engineering, University of Iowa, involves leveraging Unreal Engine, C++, Cesium, and REST APIs from USGS and NOAA to visualize and simulate hydrological data. This work aims to enhance environmental planning and decision-making processes. I am also exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to optimize these simulations. My efforts are documented in a forthcoming manuscript, poised to contribute to cutting-edge developments in hydroinformatics.
